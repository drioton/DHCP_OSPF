**Questions**

```
Why port g0/1? Because the DHCP request comes through here.
Why address 10.0.0.1? Because this is the address of the DHCP server.
Why dns-server? Only for training
Why 9.9.9.9? Because I like it.
Why did I use OSPF? Because itâ€™s faster than static IP assignment, and at least we practiced DHCP with OSPF
```

**Task**
```
Configuring DHCP Excluded Addresses on a Cisco Router
```

**Objective**
```
Learn how to exclude certain IP addresses from being assigned to DHCP clients by the DHCP server service on a Cisco IOS device.```
```
**Scenario**
```
You have been given a Cisco router configured as a DHCP server. You need to ensure that a specific range of IP addresses within the DHCP pool is excluded from being assigned to DHCP clients.
This will allow you to reserve those IP addresses for static assignments or other network devices.
